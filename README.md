# engineering-blog

## Function

This is the engineering blog of Monsanto engineers, where weâ€™ll share ideas we have, open source software we use and have created. Watch this space for future articles.

## Usage and development

* Our engineering blog is built by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), so to work on it first install Jekyll. *If* you already have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) installed, this could be as easy as

```
gem install jekyll
```

If you need to install those first, check out the install documentation for [Ruby](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)

* Next, checkout the site code

```
git clone https://github.com/MonsantoCo/engineering-blog
```

* Change into the downloaded repo

```
cd engineering-blog
```

* Create a new page

Copy one of the exsting pages, for example `about.html` and make some changes

```
cp about.html new_page.html
vi new_page.html
```

Be sure to update the 'frontmatter', that's the code between the `---` marks. Their functions are self-explanitory. After that build the site with Jekyll (see below) to see how it looks.

* Create a new post

Copy one of the exsting posts, and make some changes

```
cp _posts/2015-01-22-stoop-our-first-open-source-release.md _posts/2015-04-01-this-is-a-new-post.md
vi _posts/2015-04-01-this-is-a-new-post.md
```

Again, be sure to update the 'frontmatter', that's the code between the `---` marks. Their functions are self-explanitory. After that build the site with Jekyll (see below) to see how it looks.

* Build the site with Jekyll

```
jekyll build
```

This will build the site and put all files needed into the `_site` directory. At this point you can open the index file in a browser and view the site in a browser. In your browser just choose `File` > `Open file...` and point to the file _site/index.html

* If you want to develop the site, you can edit it and have it automatically rebuild when it senses changes to any of the files

```
jekyll build --watch
```

* Once you are done editing, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub

```
git add .
git commit -m "This is what I did to the code"
git push (git fetch; git rebase)
```

* Push to production

Once the editing is done and the post have been approved, push the existing code to `production`, by pushing it to the `gh-pages` branch.

First add and commit, if you haven't already
```
git add .
git commit -m "updates added `date`"
```

Then do the actual push

```
git push origin gh-pages
```

(NOTE: we have a script `promote_to_prod.sh` that automates these steps)
