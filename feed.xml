                <title>Stax</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were looking to build out an infrastructure in AWS (&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;), we took some time to understand how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aws/aws-cli&quot;&gt;aws-cli&lt;/a&gt; (Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services) worked. With ideas from other projects found on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, we started wrapping commands in simple BASH scripts, and pointed it to CloudFormation templates written in JSON. From there &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/monsantoco/stax&quot;&gt;stax&lt;/a&gt; was born, and we have released it as open source under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause&quot;&gt;BSD 3-clause license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Doing Docker Metrics</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;As our usage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; grows and we provision more container hosts, collecting metrics and monitoring containers and hosts has become a necessity. This post will walk you through how to glue together a few components to deploy a monitoring solution for Docker. All components are intentionally plug-and-play, so if things need to be changed any component can be (relatively) easily swapped out for an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/&quot;&gt;BASH&lt;/a&gt; may be looked down upon by
all the programming language hipsters out there, but when you are
doing system-level tasks it can be quite convenient: it&amp;#39;s on every
system, it has no dependencies to install, and it can be a powerful
language when used properly.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Using Big Data for Good</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading through blog posts, press releases, and source code you can easily get
the impression that everyone working in the Big Data space is focused on
determining what ads you are most likely to click.  From Facebook to Google to
Twitter, the modern players in IT collect massive amounts of information on
their customers and then analyze that data to provide ever more relevant ads.
As Jeff Hammeracher, formerly of Facebook and now with Cloudera, famously said,
&amp;ldquo;The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click
ads.&amp;rdquo;  The result of this nearly singular focus is that many of the tools
developed to operate in the Big Data space aren&amp;#39;t easily applied to systems
that are much more complicated than counting words and providing links to ads.
As anyone who has tried to use NoSQL databases for complicated work flows on
distributed systems can tell you, pushing the limits of these systems that
eschew features for speed can be fraught with peril, forcing you to do a lot of
engineering on your own.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Learn implicits: Scala reflection</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Implicits are arguably &lt;span class=&quot;banana&quot;&gt;the most&lt;/span&gt; unique and
misunderstood language feature of Scala.  Unlike other advanced features in the
language, they are very hard to avoid: most major libraries in Scala, starting
from Scala collections, make heavy use of implicits. That use is not invisible
to the users of the library, especially when we choose to look at the code. The
other tricky part about implicits is that there are so many ways to use them,
each with a different reason and pattern.  They can&amp;#39;t be fully explained in one
coherent post.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>We are Monsanto Engineering</title>
                
                
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;At Monsanto, we are engineers: in our history weâ€™ve engineered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#Initial_commercial_development&quot;&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstroTurf&quot;&gt;materials&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-DOPA&quot;&gt;medicines&lt;/a&gt;. Now as a purely agricultural company, we not only engineer plants, but the systems that develop, manufacture, monitor and deploy them.&lt;/p&gt;
