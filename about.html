<p>At Monsanto we produce code that powers agricultural products that support farmers all around the world. Our goal of sustainable agriculture mirrors the way we present our ideas and code to the world.</p>

<p>Join us as we take a step forward towards openness on an unprecedented level here at Monsanto. We are engineers, developers and scientists. We build the software and infrastructure that mine petabytes of DNA sequence, analyze hyperspectral images, automate cloud applications and power our global internet of things. We are Monsanto. Today we are committing to open sourcing as much of our internal code as possible. We invite you to join our journey on this engineering blog. Check back to share in our successes and failures in applying and developing cutting-edge technologies to solve the worldâ€™s biggest problems in food and agriculture.</p>
