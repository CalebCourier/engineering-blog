The computing engineers of Monsanto work to produce and deliver agricultural products that support farmers all around the world. This goal of sustainable agriculture mirrors the way we think about and present our ideas and code to the world. This blog is the start of our way to share our ideas, proceedures and software. We are expecting great things, and look forward to working in the sustainable environment of Open Source.
